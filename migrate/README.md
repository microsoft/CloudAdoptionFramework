# Code samples and templates related to cloud migration

This section of the repo is designed to store community-driven code samples and templates that prove useful during migration. Those assets augment the guidance found in the Cloud Adoption Framework's Migrate methodology.

## Featured assets

SMART Asessment: The [Strategic Migration Assessment and Readiness Tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&id=Strategic-Migration-Assessment) is available as a self-service tool for evaluating migration readiness. Completing the questions in the assessment will create a chart which outlines areas of readiness that may require more attention. 

For more information on this tool, see the accompanying whitepaper: https://aka.ms/smartpaper.

## Depricated assets

SMART Spreadsheet: The SMART spreadsheet has been deprecated. The spreadsheet has been replaced with the interactive, online assessment above. Per Microsoft policy, this spreadsheet should only be used to complete existing processes. Any new assessments of migration readiness should use the SMART Assessment listed above.
