# Code samples and templates related to landing zone creation

This section of the repo is designed to store community-driven code samples and templates that prove useful during migration. Those assets augment the guidance found in the Cloud Adoption Framework's Ready methodology.

## Featured assets

**migration-landing-zone**: Create an initial migration landing zone to quickly begin migrating your first workload to the cloud.

**migration-landing-zone-governance**: Add some initial governance controls to the migration landing zone

**import-export-blueprints**: Powershell script for importing and exporting blueprints

**terraform-landing-zones:** While blueprints are the suggested approach within the Cloud Adoption Framework, we recognize that customer's may want open-source or multi-cloud options. The Terraform landing zones provide an alternative example of the landing zone blueprints.
