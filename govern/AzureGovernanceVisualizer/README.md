```

Do you want to get granular insights on your technical Azure Governance implementation? - document it in CSV, HTML, Markdown and JSON?  
AzGovViz is a PowerShell based script that iterates your Azure Tenant´s Management Group hierarchy down to Subscription level. It captures most relevant Azure governance capabilities such as Azure Policy, RBAC and Blueprints and a lot more. From the collected data AzGovViz provides visibility on your __HierarchyMap__, creates a __TenantSummary__, creates __DefinitionInsights__ and builds granular __ScopeInsights__ on Management Groups and Subscriptions. The technical requirements as well as the required permissions are minimal.

You can run the script either for your Tenant Root Group or any other Management Group.

## Mission

"_Governance can be a complex thing_.."

Challenges:

 * Holistic overview on governance implementation  
 * Connecting the dots

AzGovViz is intended to help you to get a holistic overview on your technical Azure Governance implementation by __connecting the dots__

## Release history

__Changes__ (2022-Sep-12 / Major)

* New feature 'ALZ EverGreen' - Azure Landing Zones EverGreen for Policy and Set definitions. AzGovViz will clone the ALZ GitHub repository and collect the ALZ policy and set definitions history. The ALZ data will be compared with the data from your tenant so that you can get lifecycle management recommendations for ALZ policy and set definitions that already exist in your tenant plus a list of ALZ policy and set definitions that do not exist in your tenant. The ALZ EverGreen results will be displayed in the __TenantSummary__ and a CSV export `*_ALZEverGreen.csv` will be provided. Thanks! ALZ Team 
  * New parameter `-NoALZEverGreen` - Do not execute the ALZ EverGreen feature
* Update: Per default __DefinitionInsights__ will be written to a separate HTML file. This will improve the html file handling (browser memory usage /response time / user experience). 
  * Note: Please update your Azure DevOps and GitHub YAML files with the latest versions if you are using the webApp publishing feature
  * New parameter `-NoDefinitionInsightsDedicatedHTML` (__DefinitionInsights__ will NOT be written to a separate HTML file `*_DefinitionInsights.html`)
* Add Resource fluctuation detailed (`*_ResourceFluctuationDetailed.csv`) CSV output (add/remove, scope details, resource details)
* Fix consumption reporting for large tenants with more than 3k subscriptions (_Management Group abc has too many subscriptions <count>, exceeding CCM API Current Limit 3000_)
* Fix CSV export `*_PolicySetDefinitions.csv` - Builtin Policy definitions contained in PolicySet definitions will only show the GUID instead of the full ID as for large PolicySet definitions the field size limit in Excel may be exceeded (column: PoliciesUsed4CSV)
* BuiltIn definitions collection - add 'Static' Policy definitions (part of __DefinitionInsights__ and `*_PolicyDefinitions.csv`)
* Fix __HierarchyMap__ image quality (now .png (aka 'peng')). Thanks! Brooks Vaughn
* Use [AzAPICall](https://aka.ms/AzAPICall) PowerShell module version 1.1.23
* Optimizations

## Integrate with AzOps

Did you know you can run AzOps from Azure DevOps? Check [AzOps Accellerator](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps-Accelerator).  
You can integrate AzGovViz (same project as AzOps).

```yaml
  pipelines:
    - pipeline: 'Push'
      source: 'AzOps - Push'
      trigger:
        branches:
          include:
            - master
```

## Integrate PSRule for Azure

Let´s use [PSRule for Azure](https://azure.github.io/PSRule.Rules.Azure) and leverage over 260 pre-built rules to validate Azure resources based on the Microsoft Well-Architected Framework (WAF) principles.  
PSRule for Azure is listed as [security monitoring tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/security/monitor-tools) in the Microsoft Well-Architected Framework.

Parameter: `-DoPSRule` (e.g. `.\pwsh\AzGovVizParallel.ps1 -DoPSRule`)  
Optional parameters:  
  * `-PSRuleVersion` - Define the PSRule..Rules.Azure PowerShell module version, if undefined then 'latest' will be used
  * `-PSRuleFailedOnly` - PSRule for Azure will only report on failed resource (may save some space/noise). (e.g. `.\pwsh\AzGovVizParallel.ps1 -DoPSRule -PSRuleFailedOnly`)

Outputs:
* HTML (summarized)
  * TenantSummary
  * ScopeInsights
    * Management Group (all resources below that scope)
    * Subscription
* CSV (detailed, per resource)

TenantSummary HTML output example:

## Stats

In order to better understand the AzGovViz usage and to optimize the product accordingly some stats will be ingested to Azure Application Insights. Results of stats analysis may be shared at a later stage. 

### How/What?

If the script is run in Azure DevOps then the Repository Id and executing principal´s object Id will be used to create an unique identifier.  
If the script is not run in Azure DevOps then the Tenant Id and executing principal´s object Id will be used to create an unique identifier.

SHA384/512 hashed combination of 
* portion of the repositoryId/tenantId 
  * if repositoryId/tenantId startsWith a letter then use characters 3-8 (6 characters) of the first GUID´s block, combine them with the third GUID`s block of the principal´s objectId (4 characters), SHA512 hash them as identifier0
  * if repositoryId/tenantId startsWith a number then use characters 7-12 (6 characters) of the last GUID`s block, combine them with the second GUID´s block of the principal´s objectId (4 characters), SHA384 hash them as identifier0
* portion of the executing principal´s objectId 
  * if objectId startsWith a letter then use characters 3-8 (6 characters) of the first GUID´ block, combine them with the third GUID´ block of the repositoryId/tenantId (4 characters), SHA512 hash them as identifier1
  * if objectId startsWith a number then use characters 7-12 (6 characters) of the last GUID´ block, combine them with the second GUID´ block of the repositoryId/tenantId (4 characters), SHA384 hash them as identifier1

Combine identifier0 and identifier1
  * if objectId startsWith a letter then combine identifiers -> 'identifier0 + identifier1', SHA512 hash them as final identifier and remove dashes (string of 128 characters)
  * if objectId startsWith a number then combine identifiers -> 'identifier1 + identifier0', SHA512 hash them as final identifier and remove dashes (string of 128 characters)

To conclude the approach: taking 6 or 4 characters from tenantId/respositoryId and objectId of the executing principal to create a unique identifier, which may not be backward resolveable.

![alt text](img/identifier.jpg "identifier")

The following data will be ingested to Azure Application Insights:

```
    "accType": "ServicePrincipal / User (member) / User (Guest)",
    "azCloud": "Azure environment e.g. AzureCloud, ChinaCloud, etc.",
    "identifier": "8c62a7..53d08c0 (string of 128 characters)",
    "platform": "Console / AzureDevOps",
    "productVersion": "used AzGovViz version",
    "psAzAccountsVersion": "used Az.Accounts PS module version",
    "psVersion": "used PowerShell version",
    "scopeUsage": "childManagementGroup / rootManagementGroup",
    "statsCountErrors": "count of encountered errors",
    "statsCountSubscriptions": "less than 100 / more than 100 (no exact numbers)",
    "statsParametersDoNotIncludeResourceGroupsAndResourcesOnRBAC": "true / false",
    "statsParametersDoNotIncludeResourceGroupsOnPolicy": "true / false",
    "statsParametersDoNotShowRoleAssignmentsUserData": "true / false",

    "statsParametersPolicyAtScopeOnly": "true / false",
    "statsParametersRBACAtScopeOnly": "true / false",
    "statsTry": "count of try sending to Application Insights"
```

If you do not want to contribute to stats for AzGovViz then you can use the parameter:  
`-StatsOptOut` 

If you have any concerns or see a risk sending stats please file an issue.

Thank you for your support!

## Security

AzGovViz creates very detailed information about your Azure Governance setup. In your organization's best interest the __outputs should be protected from not authorized access!__

## Known issues

Working with Git and Windows cloning from your AzDO repository you may experience the following error:

```
fatal: cannot create directory at 'output/JSON_...': Filename too long
```

To work around that issue you may want to enable longpaths support.  
__Note the [caveats](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/8023)!__

```
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

## Facts

Disabled Subscriptions and Subscriptions where Quota Id starts with with "AAD_" are being skipped, all others are queried. More information on Subscription Quota Id / Offer numbers: [Supported Microsoft Azure offers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-cost-mgt-data#supported-microsoft-azure-offers).  

ARM Limits are not acquired programmatically, these are hardcoded. The links used to check related limits are commented in the param section of the script.
