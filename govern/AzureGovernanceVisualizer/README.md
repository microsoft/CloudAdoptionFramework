```

Do you want to get granular insights on your technical Azure Governance implementation? - document it in CSV, HTML, Markdown and JSON?  
AzGovViz is a PowerShell based script that iterates your Azure Tenant´s Management Group hierarchy down to Subscription level. It captures most relevant Azure governance capabilities such as Azure Policy, RBAC and Blueprints and a lot more. From the collected data AzGovViz provides visibility on your __HierarchyMap__, creates a __TenantSummary__, creates __DefinitionInsights__ and builds granular __ScopeInsights__ on Management Groups and Subscriptions. The technical requirements as well as the required permissions are minimal.

You can run the script either for your Tenant Root Group or any other Management Group.

## AzGovViz´s mission

<table>
<td>

"_Governance can be a complex thing_.."

Challenges:

 * Holistic overview on governance implementation  
 * Connecting the dots

__AzGovViz is intended to help you to get a holistic overview on your technical Azure Governance implementation by connecting the dots__

## Release history

__Changes__ (2021-July-28 / Major)

* As demanded by the community reactivated parameters `-PolicyAtScopeOnly` and `-RBACAtScopeOnly`
* New paramter `-AADGroupMembersLimit`. Defines the limit (default=500) of AAD Group members; For AAD Groups that have more members than the defined limit Group members will not be resolved 
* New parameter `-JsonExportExcludeResourceGroups` - JSON Export will not include ResourceGroups (Policy & Role assignments)
* New parameter `-JsonExportExcludeResources`- JSON Export will not include Resources (Role assignments)
* Bugfixes
* Performance optimization

__Changes__ (2021-July-22 / Major)

* Full blown JSON definition output. Leveraging Git with this new capability you can easily track any changes that occurred in between the previous and last AzGovViz run.  
![newBuiltInRoleDefinition](img/gitdiff600.jpg)  
_* a new BuiltIn RBAC Role definition was added_
* Renamed parameter `-PolicyIncludeResourceGroups` to , `-DoNotIncludeResourceGroupsOnPolicy` (from now Policy assignments on ResourceGroups will be included by default)
* Renamed parameter `-RBACIncludeResourceGroupsAndResources` to , `-DoNotIncludeResourceGroupsAndResourcesOnRBAC` (from now Role assignments on ResourceGroups and Resources will be included by default)
* New parameter `-HtmlTableRowsLimit`. Although the parameter `-LargeTenant` was introduced recently, still the html output may become too large to be processed properly. The new parameter defines the limit of rows - if for the html processing part the limit is reached then the html table will not be created (csv and json output will still be created). Default rows limit is 40.000
* Added NonCompliance Message for Policy assignments
* Cosmetics
* Bugfixes
* Performance optimization

* Requires PowerShell Az Modules
  * Az.Accounts
  * Az.Resources
  * ~~Az.ResourceGraph~~
  * [Install the Azure Az PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)
* Usage/command
  * `.\AzGovVizParallel.ps1 -ManagementGroupId <your-Management-Group-Id>`

### Parameters
  * `-ManagementGroupId` Management Group Id (Root Management Group Id equals your Tenant Id)
  * `-CsvDelimiter` - The world is split into two kinds of delimiters - comma and semicolon - choose yours (default is semicolon ';')
  * `-OutputPath` 
  * `-AzureDevOpsWikiAsCode` - Only use in Azure DevOps Pipeline
  * `-DoNotShowRoleAssignmentsUserData` - Scrub personally identifiable information (PII)
  * `-LimitCriticalPercentage` - Limit warning level, default is 80%
  * ~~`-HierarchyTreeOnly`~~ `-HierarchyMapOnly` - Output only the __HierarchyMap__ for Management Groups including linked Subscriptions
  * `-SubscriptionQuotaIdWhitelist` - Process only Subscriptions with defined QuotaId(s)
  * `-NoResourceProvidersDetailed` - Disables output for ResourceProvider states for all Subscriptions in the __TenantSummary__ section, in large Tenants this can become time consuming
  * `-NoASCSecureScore` - Disables ASC Secure Score request for Subscriptions. The used API is in preview you may want to disable this
  * ~~`-DisablePolicyComplianceStates`~~ `-NoPolicyComplianceStates` - Will not query policy compliance states. You may want to use this parameter to accellerate script execution or when receiving error 'ResponseTooLarge'. 
  * `-NoResourceDiagnosticsPolicyLifecycle` - Disables Resource Diagnostics Policy Lifecycle recommendations
  * `-NoAADGroupsResolveMembers` - Disables resolving Azure Active Directory Group memberships
  * `-NoAADGuestUsers` - Disables resolving Azure Active Directory User type (Guest or Member)

  * `-NoAzureConsumptionReportExportToCSV` - Azure Consumption data should not be exported (CSV)
  * `-NoScopeInsights` - Q: Why would you want to do this? A: In larger tenants the ScopeInsights section blows up the html file (up to unusable due to html file size). Use `-LargeTenant` to further reduce the output.
  * `-ThrottleLimit` - leveraging PowerShell´s parallel capability you can define the ThrottleLimit (default=5; &#x1F4A1; values from 5 up to 15 proved to perform best)
  * `-DoTranscript` - Log the console output
  * `-SubscriptionId4AzContext` - Define the Subscription Id to use for AzContext (default is to use a random Subscription Id)
  * `-PolicyAtScopeOnly` - Removing 'inherited' lines in the HTML file for 'Policy Assignments'; use this parameter if you run against a larger tenants. Note using parameter `-LargeTenant` will set `-PolicyAtScopeOnly $true`
  * `-RBACAtScopeOnly` - Removing 'inherited' lines in the HTML file for 'Role Assignments'; use this parameter if you run against a larger tenants. Note using parameter `-LargeTenant` will set `-RBACAtScopeOnly $true`
  * ~~`-CsvExport`~~ `-NoCsvExport` - Do not export enriched data for 'Role assignments', 'Policy assignments' data and 'all resources' (subscriptionId,  managementGroup path, resourceType, id, name, location, tags, createdTime, changedTime)
  * ~~`-PolicyIncludeResourceGroups`~~ `-DoNotIncludeResourceGroupsOnPolicy` - Do not include Policy assignments on ResourceGroups

  * `-JsonExportExcludeResourceGroups` - JSON Export will not include ResourceGroups (Policy & Role assignments)
  * `-JsonExportExcludeResources`- JSON Export will not include Resources (Role assignments)
  * `-LargeTenant` - A large tenant is a tenant with more than ~500 Subscriptions - the HTML output for large tenants simply becomes too big. Using this parameter the following parameters will be set: -PolicyAtScopeOnly $true, -RBACAtScopeOnly $true, -NoResourceProvidersDetailed $true, -NoScopeInsights $true
  * `-HtmlTableRowsLimit` - Although the parameter `-LargeTenant` was introduced recently, still the html output may become too large to be processed properly. The new parameter defines the limit of rows - if for the html processing part the limit is reached then the html table will not be created (csv and json output will still be created). Default rows limit is 40.000

### AzGovViz in Azure DevOps

The provided example Pipeline is configured to run based on a [schedule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/scheduled-triggers) (every 12 hours). It will push the AzGovViz markdown output file to the 'wiki' folder in the 'Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting' Repository which will feed your Wiki.

1. In Azure DevOps make sure to [enable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/navigation/preview-features?view=azure-devops&tabs=new-account-enabled) the Multistage Pipelines feature <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/multi-stage-pipelines-experience?view=azure-devops>
2. Clone the AzGovViz Repo
3. Create Pipeline, configure your pipeline selecting __Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file__, select the AzGovViz YAML from the AzGovViz (Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting) Repo
4. Grant Repository permissions: In order to allow the pipeline to push files back to our 'wiki' folder in the 'Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting' Repository the __Build Service__ Account ('%ProjectName% Build Service (%OrgName%)') must be granted with __Contribute__ permission

5. Run the Pipeline
6. Create Wiki by choosing [Publish Code as Wiki](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/wiki/publish-repo-to-wiki?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser), define the folder 'wiki' from the 'Azure-MG-Sub-Governance-Reporting' Repository as source

> Make sure your Service Connection´s Service Principal has been granted with the required permissions (see [__Required permissions in Azure Active Directory__](#required-permissions-in-azure-active-directory)).

## Integrate with AzOps

Did you know you can run AzOps from Azure DevOps? Check [AzOps Accellerator](https://github.com/Azure/AzOps-Accelerator).
You can integrate AzGovViz (same project as AzOps) by adding the following code to the AzGovViz pipeline (yml).

```yaml
  pipelines:
    - pipeline: 'Push'
      source: 'AzOps - Push'
      trigger:
        branches:
          include:
            - master
```

## Security

AzGovViz creates very detailed information about your Azure Governance setup. In your organization's best interest the __outputs should be protected from not authorized access!__

## Facts

Disabled Subscriptions and Subscriptions where Quota Id starts with with "AAD_" are being skipped, all others are queried.
