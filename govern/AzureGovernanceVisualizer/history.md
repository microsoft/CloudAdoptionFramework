* Fix Azure DevOps Pipeline correct addressing of NoDefinitionInsights variable in YAML
* Fix issue #132
* Add __[Contribution Guide](contributionGuide.md)__

__Changes__ (2022-Sep-12 / Major)

* New feature 'ALZ EverGreen' - Azure Landing Zones EverGreen for Policy and Set definitions. AzGovViz will clone the ALZ GitHub repository and collect the ALZ policy and set definitions history. The ALZ data will be compared with the data from your tenant so that you can get lifecycle management recommendations for ALZ policy and set definitions that already exist in your tenant plus a list of ALZ policy and set definitions that do not exist in your tenant. The ALZ EverGreen results will be displayed in the __TenantSummary__ and a CSV export `*_ALZEverGreen.csv` will be provided. Thanks! ALZ Team 
  * New parameter `-NoALZEverGreen` - Do not execute the ALZ EverGreen feature
* Update: Per default __DefinitionInsights__ will be written to a separate HTML file. This will improve the html file handling (browser memory usage /response time / user experience). 
  * Note: Please update your Azure DevOps and GitHub YAML files with the latest versions if you are using the webApp publishing feature
  * New parameter `-NoDefinitionInsightsDedicatedHTML` (__DefinitionInsights__ will NOT be written to a separate HTML file `*_DefinitionInsights.html`)
* Add Resource fluctuation detailed (`*_ResourceFluctuationDetailed.csv`) CSV output (add/remove, scope details, resource details)
* Fix consumption reporting for large tenants with more than 3k subscriptions (_Management Group abc has too many subscriptions <count>, exceeding CCM API Current Limit 3000_)
* Fix CSV export `*_PolicySetDefinitions.csv` - Builtin Policy definitions contained in PolicySet definitions will only show the GUID instead of the full ID as for large PolicySet definitions the field size limit in Excel may be exceeded (column: PoliciesUsed4CSV)
* BuiltIn definitions collection - add 'Static' Policy definitions (part of __DefinitionInsights__ and `*_PolicyDefinitions.csv`)
* Fix __HierarchyMap__ image quality (now .png (aka 'peng')). Thanks! Brooks Vaughn
* Use [AzAPICall](https://aka.ms/AzAPICall) PowerShell module version 1.1.23

* BugFix

__Changes__ (2022-Jul-31 / Major)

* Update on feature 'PIM (Privileged Identity Management) eligible Role assignments'

__Changes__ (2022-Jul-22 / Minor)

* New parameter `-PSRuleFailedOnly` - PSRule for Azure will only report on failed resource (may save some space/noise)

__Changes__ (2022-Jul-17 / Major)

* This change impacts __GitHub Actions only__: As the PSRule CSV output can become quite big and GitHub is actively blocking files larger than 100MB ([reference](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#file-size-limits)), the file size of the export will be validated and in case the 100MB limit is exceeded a new export excluding the column 'description' will be initiated. If that still is too large then also the column 'recommendation' will be exluded. If even then the export is exceeding the limit then the export will be deleted in order not to break the workflow at push to repo. Issue ref: #121
* New parameter `-CriticalMemoryUsage` - Define at what percentage of memory usage the garbage collection should kick in (default=90). Example: `.\pwsh\AzGovVizParallel.ps1 -CriticalMemoryUsage 70`

* Update AzAPICall CostManagement return

__Changes__ (2021-Aug-30 / Major)

* Adding feature for RBAC Role assignments: determine 'standing' from PIM (Privileged Identity Mangement) managed Role assignments

![newBuiltInRoleDefinition](img/gitdiff600.jpg)  
_* a new BuiltIn RBAC Role definition was added_
* Renamed parameter `-PolicyIncludeResourceGroups` to , `-DoNotIncludeResourceGroupsOnPolicy` (from now Policy assignments on ResourceGroups will be included by default)
* Renamed parameter `-RBACIncludeResourceGroupsAndResources` to , `-DoNotIncludeResourceGroupsAndResourcesOnRBAC` (from now Role assignments on ResourceGroups and Resources will be included by default)
* New parameter `-HtmlTableRowsLimit`. Although the parameter `-LargeTenant` was introduced recently, still the html output may become too large to be processed properly. The new parameter defines the limit of rows - if for the html processing part the limit is reached then the html table will not be created (csv and json output will still be created). Default rows limit is 40.000

* Bugfixes
* Performance optimization

__Changes__ (2021-July-07 / Major)

* Replaced parameters ~~`-NoScopeInsights`,~~ `-RBACAtScopeOnly` and `-PolicyAtScopeOnly` with `-LargeTenant`. A large tenant is a tenant with more than ~500 Subscriptions - the HTML output for large tenants simply becomes too big, therefore will not create __ScopeInsights__ and will not show inheritance for Policy and Role assignments in the __TenantSummary__ (html) output
* Add Tenant to __HierarchyMap__ including count of Role assignments
* Executing against any child Management Group will show all parent Management Groups in __HierarchyMap__
* Cosmetics / Icons

* Bugfixes
* Performance optimization

__Breaking Changes__ (2021-Feb-28)

* When granting __Azure Active Directory Graph__ API permissions in the background an AAD Role assignment for AAD Group __Directory readers__ was triggered automatically - since January/February 2021 this is no longer the case. Review the updated [__AzGovViz technical documentation__](#azgovviz-technical-documentation) section for detailed permission requirements.

__Let´s accellerate by going parallel!__  (2021-Feb-14)

* Support for PowerShell Core ONLY! No support for PowerShell version < 7.0.3
* New section __DefinitionInsights__ - Insights on all built-in and custom Policy, PolicySet and RBAC Role definitions
* New parameter `-NoScopeInsights` - Q: Why would you want to do this? A: In larger tenants the ScopeInsights section blows up the html file (up to unusable due to html file size)

* Bugfixes

Updates 2021-Jan-06 - Happy New Year
* Feature: Resolve __Azure Active Directory Group memberships__ for Role assignment with identity type 'Group' leveraging Microsoft Graph. With this capability AzGovViz can ultimately provide holistic insights on permissions granted for Management Groups and Subscriptions (honors parameter `-DoNotShowRoleAssignmentsUserData`). Use parameter `-NoAADGroupsResolveMembers` to disable the feature

* Feature: New __TenantSummary__ section '__Azure Active Directory__' -> Check all Azure Active Directory Service Principals (type=Application that have a Role assignment) for Secret/Certificate expiry. Mark all Service Principals (type=ManagedIdentity) that are related to a Policy assignments. Use parameter `-NoServicePrincipalResolve` to disable this feature
* Feature: __Cost Management / Consumption Reporting__ for Subscriptions including aggregation at Management Group level. Use parameter `-NoAzureConsumption` to disable this feature.  
__Note__: Per default the consumption query will request consumption data for the last full 1 day (if you run it today, will capture the cost for yesterday), use the parameter `-AzureConsumptionPeriod` to define a favored time period  e.g. `-AzureConsumptionPeriod 7` (for 7 days) 
* Removed parameter `-Experimental`. 'Resource Diagnostics Policy Lifecycle' enabled by default. Use `-NoResourceDiagnosticsPolicyLifecycle` to disable the feature.
* Renamed parameter `-DisablePolicyComplianceStates` to `-NoPolicyComplianceStates` for better consistency
