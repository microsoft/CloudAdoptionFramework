* Resource diagnostics capability for logs and metrics will only be checked for 1st party (Microsoft) Resource types

__Changes__ (2021-Aug-22 / Major)

* Bugfix - indirect Role assignments (applied through AAD group membership); switched to Graph beta endpoint as v1.0 only resolves users and groups, whilst we´re also interested in Service Principals - [List group transitive members](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/group-list-transitivemembers)

* New parameter `-JsonExportExcludeResourceGroups` - JSON Export will not include ResourceGroups (Policy & Role assignments)
* New parameter `-JsonExportExcludeResources`- JSON Export will not include Resources (Role assignments)
* Bugfixes
* Performance optimization

__Changes__ (2021-July-22 / Major)

* Full blown JSON definition output. Leveraging Git with this new capability you can easily track any changes that occurred in between the previous and last AzGovViz run.  
![newBuiltInRoleDefinition](img/gitdiff600.jpg)  
_* a new BuiltIn RBAC Role definition was added_
* Renamed parameter `-PolicyIncludeResourceGroups` to , `-DoNotIncludeResourceGroupsOnPolicy` (from now Policy assignments on ResourceGroups will be included by default)
* Renamed parameter `-RBACIncludeResourceGroupsAndResources` to , `-DoNotIncludeResourceGroupsAndResourcesOnRBAC` (from now Role assignments on ResourceGroups and Resources will be included by default)
* New parameter `-HtmlTableRowsLimit`. Although the parameter `-LargeTenant` was introduced recently, still the html output may become too large to be processed properly. The new parameter defines the limit of rows - if for the html processing part the limit is reached then the html table will not be created (csv and json output will still be created). Default rows limit is 40.000
* Added NonCompliance Message for Policy assignments
* Cosmetics
* Bugfixes
* Performance optimization

__Changes__ (2021-July-07 / Major)

* Replaced parameters ~~`-NoScopeInsights`,~~ `-RBACAtScopeOnly` and `-PolicyAtScopeOnly` with `-LargeTenant`. A large tenant is a tenant with more than ~500 Subscriptions - the HTML output for large tenants simply becomes too big, therefore will not create __ScopeInsights__ and will not show inheritance for Policy and Role assignments in the __TenantSummary__ (html) output
* Add Tenant to __HierarchyMap__ including count of Role assignments
* Executing against any child Management Group will show all parent Management Groups in __HierarchyMap__
* Cosmetics / Icons
* Bugfixes
* Performance optimization - optimized data collection to reduce memory utilization -> __big, fat 'Thank You'__ to Tim Wanierke and Brooks Vaughn

* added detailed [Setup](setup.md) instructions

__Changes__ (2021-June-07 / Major)

* Breaking Changes
  * Changed parameter `-CsvExport` to `-NoCsvExport` - You will need to explicitly deny CSV export using `-NoCsvExport`
  * Changed parameter `-JsonExport` to `-NoJsonExport` - You will need to explicitly deny JSON export using `-NoJsonExport`
* __HierarchyMap__ enrich Management Groups with counts on Policy assignments, scoped Policy definitions and Role assignments
* Enhanced Management Group and Subscription Diagnostic settings / list Management Groups and Subscriptions that do not have Diagnostic settings applied
* Updated API error codes / throttle handling
* Bugfixes

__Changes__ (2021-June-01 / Feature)

* Added Management Group and Subscription Diagnostic settings
* Restructure __TenantSummary__ - 'Diagnostics' gets its own section

__Changes__ (2021-May-19)

* Removed Azure PowerShell module requirement Az.ResourceGraph 
* __TenantSummary__ 'Change tracking' section. Tracks newly created and updated custom Policy, PolicySet and RBAC Role definitions, Policy/RBAC Role assignments and Resources that occured within the last 14 days (period can be adjusted using new parameter `-ChangeTrackingDays`)
* New parameters `-PolicyIncludeResourceGroups` and `-RBACIncludeResourceGroupsAndResources` - include Policy assignments on ResourceGroups, include Role assignments on ResourceGroups and Resources
* New parameters `-PolicyAtScopeOnly` and `-RBACAtScopeOnly` - removing 'inherited' lines in the HTML file; use this parameter if you run against a larger tenants
* New parameter `-CsvExport` - export enriched data for 'Role assignments', 'Policy assignments' data and 'all resources' (subscriptionId, managementGroup path, resourceType, id, name, location, tags, createdTime, changedTime)
* !_experimental_ New parameter `-JsonExport`- export of ManagementGroup Hierarchy including all MG/Sub Policy/RBAC definitions, Policy/RBAC assignments and some more relevant information to JSON
* Added ClassicAdministrators Role assignment information

* New parameter `-AzureDevOpsWikiHierarchyDirection` - Azure DevOps Markdown Management Group hierarchy tree direction. Use 'TD' for Top->Down, use 'LR' for Left->Right (default is 'TD'; use 'LR' for larger Management Group hierarchies)
* Bugfixes
* Performance optimization

__Breaking Changes__ (2021-Feb-28)

* When granting __Azure Active Directory Graph__ API permissions in the background an AAD Role assignment for AAD Group __Directory readers__ was triggered automatically - since January/February 2021 this is no longer the case. Review the updated [__AzGovViz technical documentation__](#azgovviz-technical-documentation) section for detailed permission requirements.

__Let´s accellerate by going parallel!__  (2021-Feb-14)

* Support for PowerShell Core ONLY! No support for PowerShell version < 7.0.3
* New section __DefinitionInsights__ - Insights on all built-in and custom Policy, PolicySet and RBAC Role definitions
* New parameter `-NoScopeInsights` - Q: Why would you want to do this? A: In larger tenants the ScopeInsights section blows up the html file (up to unusable due to html file size)
* New parameter `-ThrottleLimit` - Leveraging PowerShell Core´s parallel capability you can define the ThrottleLimit (default=5)
* New parameter `DoTranscript` - Log the console output
* Parameter `SubscriptionQuotaIdWhitelist` now expects an array
* Renamed parameter `-NoServicePrincipalResolve` to `-NoAADServicePrincipalResolve`
* Renamed parameter `-ServicePrincipalExpiryWarningDays` to `-AADServicePrincipalExpiryWarningDays`
